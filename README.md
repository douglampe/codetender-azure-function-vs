# CodeTender-aspnetcore

This [CodeTender](https://github.com/douglampe/codetender) template can be used to scaffold an aspnetcore 2.1 
application containing the following:

- Visual Studio solution
- Class library project with one class with one method
- Web application project with one API controller and class library class injected
- Xunit test projects and test classes for both class library and web projects

## Usage

codetender replace some-folder
```
